Pat Packet is an eager, bright packet who is excited about his first job at KPS
(Kernel Parcel Services). KPS is a large company that serves all the shipping
needs of the Apple Pro continent, so Pat knows this is an amazing opportunity.

In school, Pat trained in ICMP LAN Delivery but he hopes to get a leg up at KPS
and travel the world in TCP WAN Delivery. His ultimate goal is to one day visit
the renowned Puma Kingdom and maybe even meet its esteemed leader Ruby Rails.

One day as Pat was returning from a delivery, he overheard that Firechrome
Industries had just dropped off an important package destined for the Puma
Kingdom for Ruby Rails herself! Pat immediately rushed to the office of his boss
Benedict Buffer.

"I have to deliver this package!" exclaimed Pat.

"What do you think qualifies you to deliver this package?" asked Benedict.
"You haven't even made your first WAN delivery. This is a _**very**_
important package that must be delivered timely and safely."

"But I have been studying WAN distribution at night," replied Pat. "How will I
ever fully learn unless you give me a shot?"

Pat thought for a minute and then offered a solution.

"I heard that this package is larger than most and may require a two-packet
job," Pat continued, "What if I took the job with Pam Packet?"

Mulling over Pat's proposition, Benedict responded, "Well, Pam is our best
courier and has made the trek to the Puma Kingdom many a time. OK. Under Pam's
direction, you may deliver the package."

Elated, Pat hugged his boss and thanked him profusely. Pat then rushed off to
the WAN warehouse to meet with Pam.
