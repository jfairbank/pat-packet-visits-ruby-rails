# Pat Packet Visits Ruby Rails

Pat Packet is an eager, bright packet who is excited about his first day at KPS
(Kernel Parcel Services). KPS is a large company that serves all the shipping
needs of the Apple Pro continent, so Pat knows this is an amazing opportunity.

In school, Pat trained in UDP LAN Delivery but he hopes to get a leg up at KPS
and travel the world in TCP WAN Delivery. His ultimate goal is to one day visit
the renowned Puma Kingdom and maybe even meet its esteemed leader Ruby Rails.

One day as Pat was returning from a delivery he overheard that Firechrome
Industries had just dropped off an important package destined for the Puma
Kingdom for Ruby Rails herself! Pat immediately rushed to the office of his boss
Benedict Buffer.
