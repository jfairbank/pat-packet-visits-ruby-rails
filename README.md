# Pat Packet Visits Ruby Rails

This is the story for the "Pat Packet Visit Ruby Rails" talk given at RailsConf
2016 in Kansas City, MO. This story uses the journey of the courier Pat Packet
to explain HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP, and routing.

## Abstract

The eager Pat Packet just started his first job at KPS (Kernel Parcel Service).
He knows an important package is coming through from Firechrome Industries
destined for the Puma Kingdom for Ruby Rails herself! Pat’s boss acquiesces to
Pat’s pleas to deliver the package. Come follow Pat’s journey as he delivers
this very important package to Ruby Rails!

Whether we realize it or not, a lot of magic goes behind the scenes to deliver
an HTTP request from a browser to a Rails server. In this talk, learn about
TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, routers, and much more as they help Pat Packet deliver his
package.
